# The Space Game
Simple card game written in React JS library. I invite you to see live demo [here](https://marcinkaczor.github.io/the-space-game/).

## Notes
Hello. This is a simple card game, which is a showcase of my programming skills.
The game is designed and implemented to serve users using their web browsers as well as mobile phones.
Most operations make use of local `state` of components. Nevertheless some of them are handled with the use of a `Context API`.
User choices and scores are stored in a `sessionStorage` object. Thus, data will not be loss (e.g. by page refreshing) until closing a tab containing the game.
